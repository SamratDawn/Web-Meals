# Web Meals

Web Meals is a food delivery app which is created over the ReactJS library. It is an application that utilizes modern ReactJS hooks and features like ContextAPI to produce lightweight but efficient functionalities and executability. The app itself is connected to firebase at the backend from where it fetches its menu items and pricings. When a user places an order, the details are also relayed to the same.
